v0.4.0-alpha1
=============

  ADDED: New management command sync_database_fields to sync the database after
         a new model has been registered or a new language has been added.
         (thanks to Sébastien Fievet and the authors of django-transmeta,
          resolves issue 62)

CHANGED: Excluded tabular inlines from jQuery tabs, as they are currently
         not supported.
CHANGED: Use app-level translation files in favour of a single project-level
         one. Adds an autoregister feature similiar to the one provided by
         Django's admin. A new setting MODELTRANSLATION_TRANSLATION_FILES keeps
         backwards compatibility with older versions. See documentation for
         details. This is basically a merge from both
         django-modeltranslation-wrapper and hyperweek's branch at github.
         (thanks to Jacek Tomaszewski, Sébastien Fievet and Maxime Haineault,
          resolves issues 19, 58 and 71)
CHANGED: Moved tests to separate folder and added tests for TranslationAdmin.
         To run the tests the settings provided in model.tests.modeltranslation
         have to be used (settings.LANGUAGES override doesn't work for
         TranslationAdmin).
CHANGED: Major refactoring of the admin integration. Subclassed BaseModelAdmin
         and InlineModelAdmin. Patching options in init doesn't seem to be
         thread safe. Instead used provided hooks like get_form, get_formset
         and get_fieldsets. This should resolve several problems with the
         exclude and fieldsets options and properly support options in inlines.
         (resolves issue 72)

  FIXED: Non-unicode verbose field names showing up empty in forms.
         (resolves issue 35)
  FIXED: Dynamic TranslationOptions model name.
  FIXED: Widgets for translated fields are not properly copied from original
         fields.
         (thanks to boris-chervenkov, resolves issue 74)
  FIXED: Removed XMLField test which is deprecated since Django 1.3 and
         broke tests in Django 1.4.
         (resolves issue 75)


v0.3.3
======
Date: 2012-02-23

CHANGED: jQuery search path in tabbed_translation_fields.js. This allows use of
         a version of jQuery other than the one provided by Django. Users who
         want to force the use of Django's jQuery can include force_jquery.js.

  FIXED: Another attempt to include static files during installation.
         (resolves reopened issue 61)

         original field.
         (resolves issue 47)

         original field.
